        I got my Bachelor's Degree in Automation & Control Engineering at the
        Federal University of Uberlândia (UFU) in 2023. It's been an amazing
        journey, graduating there.

        I've participated as the Electronics team manager on the project of the
        first electric motorcycle designed for racing of Latin America, at{" "}
        <a href="">LAMAU</a>. We were competitors in the{" "}
        <a href="">MotoStudent®</a>
        competition, edition VI. We were 2nd between the rookie teams and 8th
        overall, even though we were all undergraduates with no financing or
        other projects to use as reference! We sold raffles, we sold water
        bottles at traffic lights and we made it!
      </p>
      <p>
        After finishing the motorcycle, I joined the Special Machines Laboratory
        (LAMEP) where I stayed until the end of graduation. There, in
        partnership with <a href="">Energisa</a>, we developed a portable device
        for detecting dynamic tampers in electrical energy meters on field. I
        contributed to it as an embedded software developer and R&D scholar.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, I had a GPA of 85.5/100 in graduation. Even though I don't believe
        this is the only thing that defines knowledge and effort, I'm pretty
        proud of it.
