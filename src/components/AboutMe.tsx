      <h1>Welcome to my portfolio!</h1>
      <p>Hi there! My name is Gabriel and I'm a fullstack developer.</p>
      <p>
        I am passionate about software engineering, innovation and technology in
        general. I've been working with software development since 2020, and
        went through frontend, backend and fullstack positions (I'll also do
        some devops if you need too), and I'm pretty happy working with any of
        these. In the end of the day, what I really like is to see softwares
        growing up and working smoothly!
      </p>
      <p>
        I like motorcycles, martial arts and beer as well. Feel free to invite
        me to anything that involves at least one of these and I'll be there!
      </p>
      <p>
        Hey, since you've read this far, scroll down and you'll get to know a
        little more about my education and professional experiences!
